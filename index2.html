      Share stories with us securely & confidentially
    </h1>
    <p>
      A way of sharing stories with us securely and confidentially outside of traditional email. You can of course use postal services but for sensitive information this is not advisable. SecureDrop supports anonymity, something that is virtually unachievable with email. The platform is designed to work hand in hand with the Tor network to maximise confidentiality.

    <h2>The guardian secure drop</h2>
    <p>
      Whilst the platform itself uses Tor hidden services to support anonymity it is advisable to be careful where you access it from. Small networks where Tor usage may be monitored or restricted, or public places where your screen may be be viewed by CCTV should be avoided when using the platform. We recommend that you dont jump straight from this landing page to the SecureDrop site when uploading, especially on business networks that may be monitored. Best practise would be to make a note of the Tor url and upload your content from a different machine at a later time for example an hour later.
